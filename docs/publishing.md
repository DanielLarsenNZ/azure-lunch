# Production and Publishing

In the field I record with RÃ˜DE Lavalier microphones and the [SC6-L Mobile Interview Kit](http://www.rode.com/microphones/sc6-lik)
for iPhone. I upload the recording from my iPhone via OneDrive. Then it is available on my laptop as
a stereo audio file ready for post-production.

In "studio" environments (usually a meeting room) I use two [Behringer C-1 Studio Condenser Microphones](https://www.behringer.com/Categories/Behringer/Microphones/Condenser/C-1/p/P0226).
These are the cheapest Condenser microphones I could find; they are fine for what I do. I notice that 
one of the Behringers (the older one) is getting noisier with age. So invest more money in microphones
if you would like them to last. I use a [Yamaha Steinberg UR44 Audio Interface](https://www.steinberg.net/en/products/audio_interfaces/ur_series/models/ur44.html),
which I love, recording directly into an Audacity session.

## Post-production

I use [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/). It's an outstanding audio editor for the price (a donation).
By the time I have an Audacity session open and ready to go I have one stereo audio file with the Interview
audio. Each microphone's recording is split (and panned) left and right in the stereo track, ready to
go.

### Noise reduction

The very first thing I do is apply **Noise reduction**. Before I start the interview I record a few seconds
of room noise for the Noise reduction profile. If the room is very noisy (conferences, cafes, etc) I
apply a small amount of noise reduction to help the vocals stand out. If the room is quiet (meeting rooms,
offices, areas with air conditioning noise) I use a lot more noise reduction.

    Noise reduction: 
        Noisy environment:  6db
        Quiet environment:  12db
    Sensitivity: 6.00
    Frequency smoothing: 3
    Noise: Reduce

### Roll off some bass and normalize

Next I apply the **Bass and Treble** effect:

    Bass:   -3.0db
    Treble:  0.0db
    Output:  0.0db

And then **Normalize**:

    Remove DC offset: Tick
    Normalize peak amplitude to: 0.0db
    Normalize stereo channels independently: Untick

Now I trim and edit the interview. I do this before I split the tracks to mono to make it easier to edit.

### Sub-mix

Once I'm happy with the interview edits I **Split Stereo to Mono** and **pan** the Interviewer track
30% left and pan the Guest to centre. I then sub-mix down to a new Stereo Track ready for compression
which I want to be on the overall Stereo mix.

### Compression and limiting

Finally I add compression and limiting. This will really help the voices cut through the background and
make it easier for people to listen on ear buds and in noisy environments.

    Compressor:
        Threshold: -12db to -20db
        Noise floor: -40db
        Ratio: 4:1
        Attack: 0.2 secs
        Release: 1.0 secs
        Make-up gain for 0db after compressing: Ticked
        
    Limiter: 
        Soft limit
        Input gains: 3db to 6db
        Limit to: 0db
        Hold: 10ms
        Apply Make-up gain: Yes

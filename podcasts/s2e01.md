<p>We kick off the 2019 season with a quick review of what we have been up to over the
(NZ) summer break, skilling up with Microsoft/Learn and Dan has a report from Seattle. We talk private
networking with PaaS, Network infrastructure at a global scale and how this enables amazing services
like Azure Front Door and Cosmos DB. And wrap up with what we have planned for this Season 2 of Azure
Lunch!</p>

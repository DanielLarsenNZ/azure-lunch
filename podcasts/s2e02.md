<p>In this episode Dan picks Matt's brain on "Serverless" and what is in a name - what does Serverless
really mean? And where are all the servers? In this wide-ranging talk we discuss which workloads suit
Serverless technologies, common programming languages and frameworks including the new Azure Functions
Runtime 2.0, and the radidly expanding range of services that fall into the serverless category: Azure
Functions, Open FaaS (Functions as a Service), Serverless Databases (!) and global platform services
that present as "serverless" including Cosmos DB, Azure Event Grid, Event Hubs and more!</p>

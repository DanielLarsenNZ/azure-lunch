<p>In this episode I have the good fortune to spend some time with Chimène Bonhomme - A Data Scientist 
and Technical Solutions Professional at Microsoft New Zealand. Chimène lists a Masters of Information 
Technology, Business Intelligence and Data Science, as well as a Bachelor of Health Science, Medical 
and Molecular Biosciences as two of her many amazing achievements. In this episode I ask Chimène for 
her perspective on Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, asking the question: 
How much data science is enough to be dangerous?</p>

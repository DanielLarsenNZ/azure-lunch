<p>Divya Sangar started her career in Fiji doing Dialup Internet and PABX installations (when we used
connect customers by crimping on the MDFs) and now works on one of the largest private networks in the
world, the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/global-infrastructure/global-network/">Azure
Global Network</a>. In this episode Divya takes us on her journey from Network Engineer to Global Networking
Blackbelt, unraveling mysteries along the way of this fascinating area of computing that enables distributed
computing at global scale.</p>

<p>We talk specifically about the recently launched ExpressRoute Edge Node in Auckland, New Zealand
(Tamaki Makaurau, Aotearoa) which allows New Zealand customers to connect locally to the Azure global
network, and touch on new Network Services offered by Azure including Front Door, Global Reach and Virtual 
WAN.</p>

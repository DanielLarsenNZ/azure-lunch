<p>Divya Sangar started her career in Fiji doing Dialup Internet and PABX installations (when we used
to connect customers by hand, crimping on to the MDFs). Now she works on one of the largest private
owned fibre networks in the world, the Microsoft <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/global-infrastructure/global-network/">Azure
Global Network</a>. In this episode Divya takes us on her journey from Network Engineer to Global Networking
Blackbelt, unraveling mysteries along the way of this fascinating area of computing that enables distributed
services to operate at truly global scale.</p>

<p>We also talk about the recently launched ExpressRoute Edge Node in Auckland, which allows 
New Zealand customers to connect locally to the global Azure network, reducing the costs of internetworking
with our Australian Azure Regions and the world. The ExpressRoute Edge Node in Auckland is a first for
New Zealand, unlocking new Network Services including Azure Front Door, ExpressRoute Global Reach and
Virtual WAN.</p>

<p>At Microsoft //Build 2019 I spent time talking to some of the people who build the products and services
that run on Azure and on Windows. In this Build Special I combine two interviews; the first with Dan
Rosanova, Group Program Manager for Azure Messaging, and the second with Craig Loewen, Program Manager 
for Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).</p>

<p>But first let's hear Dan Rosanova talk about two of the amazing messaging services provided by the
Azure Platform: Azure Service Bus and Event Hubs, including recently announced Availability Zone
(AZ) support and Azure Event Hubs for Apache Kafka.</p>

<p>Next we hear from Craig Loewen from the Windows Subsystem for Linux team - yes, you heard right!
For three years now Microsoft have been shipping a Linux Subsystem in Windows 10 which means you can
use many Linux commands at the command line inside Windows. Pretty mind-blowing stuff in 2016! But now
that all seems par for the course as at Microsoft //Build 2019 we announced that, this year, we will
ship a full Linux Kernel in Windows 10 as part of the major improvements in the next version of the
Windows Subsystem for Linux - WSL2. Here's Craig to tell us all about it.</p>

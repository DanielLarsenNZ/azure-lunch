<p>In this fascinating interview, recorded at Microsoft //Build 2019, I talk with <strong>Sharad Agrawal</strong>, 
Program Manager at Microsoft about <strong>Azure Front Door</strong>. This remarkable service fronts
some of the largest web properties on the planet, including Xbox, Bing, Teams, and Azure DevOps, serving <em>millions</em> of requests per <em>second</em>.</p>

<p>Azure Front Door is now generally available to all customers, offering a truly global Layer-7 Load-balancer
with Web Application Firewall, DDOS protection, automatic SSL certificate management and 
much more. Sit back and enjoy as Sharad takes us deep into this service and the Microsoft
global network that powers it.</p>

<p>As always, Sharad and I are employees of Microsoft and our opinions are our own.</p>

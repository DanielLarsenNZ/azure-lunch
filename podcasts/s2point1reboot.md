<p>Azure Lunch podcast had an unplanned outage a few months ago while we took time adjust to a couple
of pretty big changes. In this new "Series 2.1" we reboot with a new show, a new sponsor, and best of all
lots of amazing guests. Daniel has been lucky enough to travel across the world to Microsoft //Build 2019
and to Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington. As well as other events at home in Auckland, NZ.</p>

and Specialists, showcasing just a few of the people that work hard every day to make Microsoft Azure
awesome:</p>
